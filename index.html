        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Senior Projects provides a capstone experience for the major, culminating in the Senior Show in June. You will work closely with the faculty to focus on a project defined by the your individual skills and professional interests. Each project will employ a process of research, conceptual development, prototype development, refinement, and production. You will also engage in critical analyses by reviewing and critiquing othersʼ works.</p>

        <p>The 159A Senior Projects class focuses on interactive media, which includes game design, interactive installation, dynamic websites, creative coding, and electronics. Senior Projects is the only course offered that is directed by each studentʼs individual goals, interests and skills.</p>

        <p>Interactivity and games should not be understood as limiting a project to technically mediated forms. Works in all mediums are considered. You are encouraged to work with media that allow you to hone in on your conceptual and visual sensibilities, and with which you already have proficiency.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>Expectations</h3>
        <span class='label'>Grading.</span> Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
          <ul>
            <li>Participation 20%</li>
            <li>Process documentation 15%</li>
            <li>Final documentation 15%</li>
            <li>Final project 50%</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs.</p>
        
        <p><span class='label'>Participation.</span> Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, offer feedback during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If there are concerns please let me or Stalgia know as soon as possible.</p>
        
        <p><span class='label'><a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KI-6mijcypeczlwRfitTRq2lbtJpA3hB1dGWXfkrv7U/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>Attendance.</a></span> Each unexcused absence will result in one full letter grade deducation. Three unexcused absences will result in a failed grade in the class. If there is an emergency and you must miss class, email <a href='mailto:stalgia.grigg@gmail.com'>Stalgia</a> before class. Absences will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you will be marked tardy. Three tardies results in one unexcused absence. Your attendance can be viewed <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KI-6mijcypeczlwRfitTRq2lbtJpA3hB1dGWXfkrv7U/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>here</a>, any disputes should be discussed with the TA within two weeks.</p>
        
        <p><span class='label'>Late work.</span> If you turn in a project late you miss the opportunity to share during the review and receive feedback, an essential part of this process. If you don’t have a project done at the deadline, we will discuss an alternative deadline and one letter grade will be subtracted from that project. If you miss this second deadline, you forfeit credit for that project. Weeklies are graded P/F based on completion on the day they are due, these cannot be turned in late. If you are absent from class you are still responsible for posting the work due on your index page. Any work not posted in absence will be considered late, unless prior arrangements are made with me.</p>

        <h3><a href='https://github.com/voidlab/diversity-statement'>Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</a></h3>
        <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.</p>

        <h3>Disability Services</h3>
        <p>UCLA strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on a disability, please let me know as soon as possible. It is necessary for you to register with the <a href='http://www.cae.ucla.edu/'>UCLA Center for Accessible Education</a> so that we can establish reasonable accommodations. After registration, make arrangements with me to discuss how to implement these accommodations.</p>

        <h3 id="p1">PECHA KUCHA (DUE 4/2)</h3>
        <div id="p1-content" style='display:block;'>
          <p>We will open the first class with 5 minute pecha kucha presentations (15 slides x 20 seconds each). The goal of your presentation is to share who you are, what kinds of work you make, and what you want to focus on for your senior project.</p>

          <p>Please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JDzS5hW8lYUJvmH7PK9ngVp0TmfU-CPuBVhYkqcGSU4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this pecha kucha template</a> which has auto-timed slides set up for you. There are 15 slides, each designed to play for 20 seconds. Here are instructions to make a copy and setup your presentation:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Open the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JDzS5hW8lYUJvmH7PK9ngVp0TmfU-CPuBVhYkqcGSU4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">template</a>. Go to File > Make a Copy.</li>
            <li>Fill in the slide contents (you can delete the numbers).</li>
            <li>When it's done, go to File > Publish to the web, and select these settings and click Publish:
              <img src="imgs/publish.png">
            </li>
            <li>Copy the link and test it in your browser. In the URL, add an extra 0 to the part that says 2000, so it reads "delayms=20000". This will make the slides advance every 20s.</li>
            <li>Add this updated URL and your name to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d0DW5Dq2gJWVkJ9mnUsIlXAJxOPnJl_BGVzjzeZUN_E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this doc</a> before the start of the first class on 4/2.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>

          <p>Slides 1-10 should contain previous work you've done that best illustrates your skills and interests. This need not cover everything you’ve made, just the most relevant work. You might include images, text, or video clips. You can present 10 different works, or multiple images of a fewer number of projects.</p>

          <p>Slides 11-12 should contain your initial direction for your senior project. Determine a topic or issue that you would like to focus on for this project. It could be something in the news, a question on your mind, an issue you feel needs more awareness, or anything else. The topic should be <b>specific</b>, and something you can form a <b>unique point of view</b> around. That is, "cats" or "the color red" are probably not appropriate topics. The first two slides should introduce your topic of focus and tell us why it's interesting to you.</p>

          <p>Slides 13-15 should contain three <b>different</b> possible ideas for what your senior project will be. What form it may take, how it might specifically address your topic, what it might communicate. Remember, you only have 20 seconds to talk about each idea so your slide will need to be concise.</p>

          <p>The timing of a pecha kucha is fast. <b>You will need to rehearse in advance.</b> This is your senior project. This is your chance to start with momentum and make a really great project.</p>
